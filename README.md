# Image-Coordinate-Plotter
A web-based tool to upload images and interactively capture pixel coordinates by clicking on the image. Each click generates a `var(x,y);` entry and displays it in a scrollable text area. This is especially useful for web/game developers or UI planners needing precise layout coordinates.
